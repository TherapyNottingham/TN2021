People choose to come to therapy for all sorts of reasons. Often people come with a specific issue they want to address, such as anxiety, a problematic relationship, work stress or the impact of trauma or abuse.

However some people just have a general sense of dis-ease in their life for which they can’t make sense of and wish to explore this. Often your goals for therapy will change and evolve over time as you continue with your sessions, and that’s fine too, it’s a natural part of the process.

There is no specific criteria for you to meet in order to attend psychotherapy (although this is likely to be different when accessing therapy through the NHS). If you are not sure if therapy is right for you or not, then it is possible to have an initial chat on the phone with a psychotherapist, who will be able to support you to make that decision. If you decide to go ahead, the first few sessions will be assessment sessions so that you and your therapist can decide together whether to proceed - you are not committed straight away! 

If you’ve been sitting on the idea of getting therapy for a while, then it is definitely worthy pursuing!

Abi currently has some new appointment times available.
