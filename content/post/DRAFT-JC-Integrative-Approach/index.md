## What it is to be human
	- My starting point when thinking about people in general, and particularly with clients, are my core humanistic values [^1].  These are:
	- ### Every human being has essential worth
	- Everyone is 'born OK' and with a tendency to what is best for them, to survive, and assuming the choice is available to them, will prefer harmony over chaos and harm.  Our being, our existence, is unquestionable, for we are.  But our actions are available for scrutiny and evaluation.  In psychotherapy, one way of thinking about the move towards being healthy is restoring the client's belief in themselves as being an intrinsically worthwhile person.
	- ### People are neither good nor bad - there is potential for both in human beings
	- Given a healthy environment, we will all move towards what is good for us, and what is good for others.  The detail of what this looks like of course changes from moment to moment.  But at whatever age we are, we make what sense we can of our situation and experiences, and make choices accordingly.
	- ### We all have the capacity to choose
	- One of the more famous versions of this idea comes from Frankl [^2] who concluded that even when every other freedom has been removed, we remain able to choose our attitude towards whatever our circumstances may be.  Of course, we can always make what we later see as 'bad' decisions, and the reasons for this are always the same; inadequate parenting, not knowing any better, or through distorting reality based on our interpretations of early experiences.  In psychotherapy we aim to identify and work through these factors, which allows for a wider range of choices.  When we are aware of more options, we are freed from the apparent imposition of ourselves or others.
	- ### People are responsible for themselves
	- Inevitably, things will happen to us throughout our life that are outside of our control, and not as we would have liked.  These moments feed into our ongoing experience, from which we base our decisions.  One of the choices we can make is to not take responsibility for ourselves or the choices we make.  When we attempt to deny this responsibility, we manipulate the environment through distortions, and blame others and events for what we do.
	- ### People have the power to change and grow
	- The Humanistic perspective is primarily concerned with the inner self, rather than what happens in the outer world.  The emphasis is on what we think and feel, and using this as a way of breaking through to something new, or recovering what has been lost somewhere in the past.  Fundamental to this, is the knowledge that people can, and do change.  The exact nature of this change is up to the individual to decide.
	- ### Human beings are whole entities within the totality of their environment
	- We can only be who we are in the context of the world in which we live.  It is not possible to know ourselves separate from the experiences and relationships we have with others.  One way of thinking about ourselves is that within us, we have expressions of our physical, emotional, thinking, and spiritual self.  We will return to this idea of there being different 'parts' of self later.
	- ### The truth about the nature of human beings is multifaceted
	- Beyond those parts of ourselves, there is a whole self that is more than the sum of those combined parts.  Many human experiences extend beyond our rational, pragmatic, and purely objective perception, and each person's experience has it's own truth.
- ## The relational
	- I believe that as human beings, we are essentially relational creatures.  Our need for relationship is a primary motivation of human behaviour [^3]. We need and seek relationships, we exist within relationships, and it is also in relationships that we can change and grow.
	- As a psychotherapist, I am considering the _contact_, that is, the way in which our need for relationship is met.  Put simply, contact refers to the quality of the transactions between two people.  This includes:
		- awareness of ourselves
		- awareness of the other
		- sensitively meeting the other
		- authentic acknowledgement of ourselves.
	- This awareness extends to our full awareness of physiological sensations, feelings, needs, sensorimotor (sensation and movement) processes, thoughts, and memories that occur within us, and also to engage with a full awareness of external events as registered by our sensory organs (what we can see, hear, touch, taste, and smell).
	- ### Relational needs [^4]
	- There could be any number of unique relational needs, however the ones listed here represent the needs most commonly associated with significant relationships.  These needs are present throughout life, not just associated with childhood and early development.
	- #### The need for security
	  This is the visceral experience of having our physical and emotional vulnerabilities protected. It involves the experience that our variety of needs and feelings are human and natural. Security is a sense of simultaneously being vulnerable and in harmony with another.
	- #### The need to feel validated, affirmed and significant
	  This is the need to have the other person validate the significance and function of our intrapsychic processes of affect, fantasy, and constructing of meaning, and to validate that our emotions are a significant intrapsychic and interpersonal communication.  It includes the need to have all our relational needs affirmed and accepted as natural.  This need is a relational request for the other person to be involved through providing a quality of interpersonal contact that validates the legitimacy of relational needs, the significance of affect, and the function of intrapsychic processes.
	- #### Acceptance by a stable, dependable, and protective other person
	  We need to have significant others from whom we gain protection, encouragement, and information.
	- #### The confirmation of personal experience
	  The need to have experience confirmed is manifested through the desire to be in the presence of someone who is similar, who understands because he or she has had a like experience, and whose shared experience is confirming. It is the quest for mutuality, a sense of walking the same path in life together with a companion who is “like me.” It is the need to have someone appreciate and value our experience because they phenomenologically know what that experience is like.
	- #### The need for self-definition
	  To know and express our own uniqueness and to receive acknowledgement and acceptance by the other.
	- #### The need to have an impact on the other person
	  Impact refers to having an influence that affects the other in some desired way. An individual’s sense of competency in a relationship emerges from agency and efficacy—attracting the other’s attention and interest, influencing what may be of interest to the other person, and affecting a change of affect or behavior in the other.
	- #### The need to have the other initiate
	  Initiation refers to the impetus for making interpersonal contact with another person. It is the reaching out to the other in some way that acknowledges and validates the importance of him or her in the relationship.
	- #### The need to express love
	  Love is often expressed through quiet gratitude, thankfulness, giving affection, or doing something for the other person.

- ## The developmental
	- Human developmental theory leads to the understanding that our awareness of self and self-esteem emerge out of contact in relationship[[^5]].  How we experience ourselves within relationships goes on to provide and inform a basic organising principle for all future interpersonal interactions.  This process starts from birth, and continues throughout life.  While there may not be clearly identified 'stages' of development which follow neatly one after the other, it is true that early developmental deficits and difficulties will have an impact on later functioning.
- ## Psychological health and how we think about problems
	- First, there is a little bit of theory to cover.  We use the term 'ego state' to describe a state of mind which has a corresponding system of thoughts, feelings, postures, expressions, and external behaviours.  The pattern of behaviours and the state of mind we experience at any given moment forms the active ego state.
	- For example, sometimes people will talk from their Parent ego state, using all of the feelings, attitudes, and expressions that their mother or father used many years beforehand.  At other times, the same person may react as a young child, that is, from their Child ego state, seeing things as they did when they were only five years old.  They may then switch to the Adult ego state and react with emotions, ideas, and behaviours which are situationally appropriate, and not disproportionately influenced by either the Child or Parent ego states.  This last state is the psychologically healthy one.
	- Problems arise when there is conflict between the different ego states, and there are some very common reactions to this.
		- 1) Regression to the Child ego state in response to the internal influence of the Parent ego state
		  2) Active manifestation of the Parent ego state, which is directed at someone else as an attempt to avoid the internal pressure
		  3) Transference, where an ego state (usually the Parent) is projected onto another person, and then reacted to as the child actually reacted, or wished they could have in the past
	- Psychological problems emerge when outdated ideas, images, and emotions contaminate the present day 'here and now' perceptions of the Adult ego state.  These are unconscious processes, and so the person believes that they are responding to current stimuli, considering current feelings and sensations, and so behaving appropriately to the situation; when in fact, this is not true.  Because of the unconscious nature of this, the person has no reason to challenge or update the inappropriate reactions.  As with parents and children, some degree of conflict between ego states is inevitable, and the healthy ego state is one in which the Adult is in charge, having integrated the content and experiences of both the Parent and Child ego states.
