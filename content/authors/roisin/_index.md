Roisin is an integrative psychotherapist, who works within a humanistic, relational, and developmental framework. 

Before qualifying as a psychotherapist, Roisin gained extensive experience working in the NHS, education, and the care sectors.  As a psychotherapist she has worked within the voluntary sector and educational settings, where she has worked with a wide range of issues including depression, anxiety, chronic illness, self-harm, sexual abuse, trauma, PTSD, and relationship difficulties.

Roisin has a passionate interest in working with clients who have experienced childhood and developmental trauma, along with chronic illness.  She prioritises developing a therapeutic relationship with clients, where feel safe allows exploring difficult and painful issues.  She understands that when things become difficult it can be hard to reach out, and that by taking this brave step, she can be alongside you on your journey to help you reach your desired goals.
