## Useful information

- Unlike many Direct Debit agreements, we will not be taking money out of your account every week no matter what
- We will only request payment from your bank when we invoice you for an appointment, so if, for example, you are away on holiday and have agreed this with your psychotherapist in advance, we will not request payment
- There can be a delay between the time when we request the payment from your bank, and the money leaving your account
- If you ever want to check, you can see the payment status of your invoices in our [Client Portal](https://clientportal.uk.powerdiary.com/clientportal/therapynottingham)
- There is more information over on the [Direct Debit FAQ]({{< relref "/faq/payment" >}}) page
- You can always contact us at [finance@therapynottingham.co.uk](mailto:finance@therapynottingham.co.uk) with any finance and billing related enquiries
