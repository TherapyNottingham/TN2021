## Why do people come to therapy?

People come to therapy for all kinds of reasons. Psychotherapy can help manage and address a wide range of emotional issues, difficulties and experiences. It’s not about being “crazy” or “mad”, but it is about making changes – both in your life, and in how you feel.

Psychotherapy comes under the broad heading of ‘talking therapies’.  By talking about and exploring the things that you have experienced, how you are feeling, and the thoughts you are having, you are then able to make positive changes.  It’s not possible for us to go back in time and change what has already happened, but it is possible to reduce or remove the negative impact that those things may be still be having on you now.

### Examples of the kinds of things people come to therapy for include:

- Stress and anxiety
- Anger
- Depression
- Relationship issues
- Workplace problems
- Family difficulties
- Issues relating to sexuality and identity
- Knowing that things ‘just don’t feel right’

### People also choose to come to therapy having experienced significant or difficult events, for example:

- Bereavement
- Divorce or separation
- Sexual abuse or assault
- Harassment
- Bullying

Whatever apparent similarities there may be, your individual experience is inevitably unique. This means that your experience of coming to therapy will also be unique.
