## What is Supervision?

Supervision is a formal process in which a qualified or trainee psychotherapist or counsellor regularly reviews their client work to a designated supervisor as a way of enhancing their practice through careful reflection on the process.


## The value of good supervision

The main purpose of supervision is to ensure the efficacy of the therapistâ€™s psychotherapy practice which, in turn, will enable a therapist to work towards the best possible psychotherapy practice for their clients.

Here at Therapy Nottingham, we work as psychotherapists within a relational and developmentally focused integrative approach.  You can read more about [our Integrative approach to psychotherapy here]({{< relref "/about/integrative" >}}).  This is reflected in how we work as supervisors.


## Choosing a Supervisor

Similar to choosing a psychotherapist, your relationship with your supervisor is an important consideration.  You need to be able to trust your supervisor, to be honest with them, and not just celebrate the successes but also bring the parts of yourself and your practice that you are less proud of, less certain of, or perhaps ashamed of.  This is how we learn and develop our practice.
