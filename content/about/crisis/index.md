## If you feel like you might attempt suicide, or may have seriously harmed yourself, you need urgent medical help.

- call [999](tel:999) for an ambulance
- go straight to your nearest A&E, if you can
- or call your local crisis team, if you have their number

If you can't do this by yourself, ask someone to help you.

Mental health emergencies are serious. You are not wasting anyone's time.

# If you don't want to call 999

If you can keep yourself safe for a short while, but you still need urgent advice:

- contact NHS [111](tel:111) if you live in England
- contact NHS [111](tel:111) or NHS Direct ([0845 46 47](tel:08454647)) if you live in Wales
- contact your GP surgery and ask for an emergency appointment. Many GPs are now offering these remotely because of coronavirus.
