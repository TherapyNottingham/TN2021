## How do I pay for my appointments
- For your first appointment with us, we ask you to pay in advance.  After that, you will receive an invoice by email following your appointment.
- You can also access your appointments and invoices, and pay them online at our [Client Portal](https://clientportal.uk.powerdiary.com/clientportal/therapynottingham).

## Which payment methods do you accept?
- You can pay online using your card by clicking the 'Pay Now' button on your invoice.
- You can set up a Direct Debit by following the link in your invoice email.  This will allow your future invoices to be paid automatically.
- You can pay by bank transfer

## If I set up a Direct Debit, will the money come out of my account every week?
- Only if you have had an appointment with us, or received an invoice.

## When does the Direct Debit payment get taken?
- We will request the Direct Debit payment following your appointment.  This is usually also the time when you will receive an invoice.
- You will then be notified of this by the Direct Debit service (we use Go Cardless), giving you notice for the payment. Usually, this is two working days.
- The payment will then leave your account, usually within three working days.
- Because of this, it can be up to a week until the payment leaves your account.
