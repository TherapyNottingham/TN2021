Opening in 2022, the Therapy Nottingham service will be expanding, and moving to a new city-centre location.

<!--more-->

Nottingham will be getting a new Integrative Psychotherapy service in 2022, as Therapy Nottingham expands with more psychotherapists joining the team.  We are very excited about this news, and work is already underway in securing and reconfiguring the new building.  We will remain in Nottingham City Centre, retaining the excellent central and easy to get to location, but with much expanded space for additinal members of the team.

More details will be confirmed as we progress, and we are looking forwards to being able to provide high quality Integrative Psychotherapy for even more people.
